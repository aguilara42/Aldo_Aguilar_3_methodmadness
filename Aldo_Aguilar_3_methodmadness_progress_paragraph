For my project I plan on making a geometric pattern using squares and circles.
At the moment I only have five methods, I have three methods dedicated to 
making rectangles at diffrent opacities and colors. My green rectangles start
in the top left corner and splatter outwards and increase in spread. Then
I have red rectangles in a diaginal moving to the lower left corner. My blue 
rectangles do the same to the lower right corner. My plan is to have both
the blue and red rectangles make a spiral using Bresenham's circle. I have another method not yet writen out but it will add diffrent color or circle 
spots all around. My last methodcalls my rectangles and circles within a for
loop to draw my all the shapes. I call this method within the main class within
a for loop.
